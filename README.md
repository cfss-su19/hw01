## Introduction
Hi, my name is Roy, and I am a visiting undergraduate student at the University of Chicago! I study *Economic History and Economics* at the **London School of Economics**, and I am here to learn some basic programming that will help me with my major.

**List of things about me:**
* I am from Singapore
  * Tiny island in Southeast Asia, barely larger than Chicago city!
* I am a big soccer fan
  * Team I support is [Arsenal FC](https://www.arsenal.com/)
* Music taste: R&B, Rap, some Pop

That's all! Have a picture of the Singapore skyline because why not.
