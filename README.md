## Rising Third-Year in the College
I am a rising third-year in the College, double majoring in **political science** and **economics** *with a specialization in business economics*. I will also hopefully minor in *near eastern languages and civilizations*.


## Backround
I am orginally from Fairfield, Connecitcut, but went to high school in Riverdale New York at SAR High School.


## General Hobbies, interests, and likes/dislikes
1. Eating all things pumpkin - fall is my favorite time of the year. **pumpkin ice cream**, **pumpkin spice lattes**, **pumpkin pie** the options are endless
2. Sailing - when the never ending Chicago winter is over
3. Hiking - also when the aforementioned Chicago winter is over

## Some more favorites that are now affected by the Chicago Winter or season - pumpkin seems to go out sytle in the winter

1. *To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee is my favorite book
2. I enjoy reading *The Economist* and may have paid more money than I should have for a print copy of the magazine at Midway airport last week
3. My favorite musical is *Come from Away* ![Image of Come from Away] https://images.app.goo.gl/EqriepACZkfi2mZs8
