I am a rising third year student at the University of Chicago and am pursuing a double major in political science and English. I am particularly interested in rhetoric and political philosophy. In addition to my majors, I also  enjoy studying languages and film theory, and I intend to take taking more classes in both during the remainder of my time at the University. The attached is the link to a photograph that was analysed in a film class that I took last quarter. The discussion about the photograph taught me a lot about the specific qualities of film as a medium and made me appreciate visual art in a way I had never considered before.
