# MACS 20500: Homework 1  
## James Zimmerman  

  
### Intro  
Hi, I'm James Zimmerman! I'm a rising third year here at UChicago majoring in **Public Policy** and in **Economics**.

### Facts About Me  
  + I'm from **New York City**, living my entire life in the same apartment before leaving for college.  
  + I've become really interested in studying **film** over my second year. I can enjoy any movie that isn't horror, no matter how good or bad.  
  + I also enjoy **history**, particularly Reconstruction and the 20th-century United States.  
  + I played basketball and baseball growing up. Today, I too closely follow the **NBA** and the Pittsburgh Steelers.  

### Reflections  
I did not find this assignment itself to be particularly difficult, as I had previous practice editing files in R Markdown. The tricky bit was learning to use GitHub to clone and then pull request the file. I hope this works!

### Conclusion
I end with a picture of New York City at sunrise.
